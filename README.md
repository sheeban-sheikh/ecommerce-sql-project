# 🛒 E-Commerce Sales Analysis Using SQL

This project showcases the use of SQL to analyze a simulated e-commerce database and extract actionable business insights. It includes two sets of SQL questions — one based on interview-style logic and another based on real company-level problem-solving.

---

## 📚 Dataset Used

The project uses 3 relational tables:

- `customers`: Customer details like ID, name, country
- `orders`: Order metadata like order date, customer, total amount
- `order_items`: Order item-level details like product, quantity, unit price
